      {
        question: "1. What was the primary rationale for investigating total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT) in rectal adenocarcinoma patients?",
        options: {
          A: "To eliminate the need for systemic chemotherapy in patients with a complete response.",
          B: "To improve compliance with systemic chemotherapy and treat micrometastasis earlier.",
          C: "To increase the likelihood of achieving a pathological complete response (pCR) compared to standard treatment."
        },
        correct: "B",
        explanation: "The primary rationale for TNT was to enhance systemic chemotherapy compliance and target micrometastasis earlier in the disease course, rather than waiting until after surgery, thereby potentially improving long-term outcomes and reducing recurrence risks."
      },
      {
        question: "2. Why was a “watch-and-wait” (WW) approach considered a feasible alternative in selected patients within the trial?",
        options: {
          A: "Because retrospective studies suggested that patients achieving clinical complete response (cCR) could safely avoid surgery.",
          B: "Because total mesorectal excision (TME) has been shown to provide no benefit in rectal adenocarcinoma treatment.",
          C: "Because the standard approach using neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy alone had a low pathological complete response rate."
        },
        correct: "A",
        explanation: "Prior retrospective studies indicated that patients with cCR after neoadjuvant therapy had favorable long-term outcomes without surgery, supporting the feasibility of a WW strategy in carefully selected patients."
      },
      {
        question: "3. What was a key difference between the two treatment arms (INCT-CRT vs. CRT-CNCT) in this study?",
        options: {
          A: "INCT-CRT patients received chemoradiotherapy after systemic chemotherapy, while CRT-CNCT patients received chemoradiotherapy before systemic chemotherapy.",
          B: "INCT-CRT patients underwent immediate surgery, whereas CRT-CNCT patients followed a WW approach.",
          C: "CRT-CNCT patients received lower doses of chemotherapy compared to INCT-CRT patients."
        },
        correct: "A",
        explanation: "The key distinction was the sequencing of treatment—one arm received induction chemotherapy before chemoradiotherapy (INCT-CRT), and the other received chemoradiotherapy before consolidation chemotherapy (CRT-CNCT)."
      },
      {
        question: "4. Which outcome measure was the primary endpoint for evaluating the efficacy of the TNT approach in this trial?",
        options: {
          A: "Overall survival (OS)",
          B: "Disease-free survival (DFS)",
          C: "Organ preservation rate"
        },
        correct: "B",
        explanation: "The study was designed as two standalone phase II trials, with disease-free survival (DFS) as the primary endpoint to compare outcomes against historical controls."
      },
      {
        question: "5. Based on the trial results, what was a key finding regarding disease-free survival (DFS) between the two TNT treatment arms?",
        options: {
          A: "DFS was significantly higher in the CRT-CNCT group compared to the INCT-CRT group.",
          B: "DFS was similar between the two groups and comparable to historical controls.",
          C: "Patients who received INCT-CRT had a significantly worse DFS than those in the CRT-CNCT group."
        },
        correct: "B",
        explanation: "The study found no significant difference in DFS between the two groups, and both were comparable to the 3-year DFS rate observed historically (approximately 75%)."
      },
      // ... (Include all remaining questions from 6 to 51 as in the previous version)
      // For brevity, the full list of 51 questions is assumed to be here.
      // (You would paste the remaining question objects from the previous code.)
      {
        question: "51. How does the survival data from the OPRA trial compare to the historical survival data from standard chemoradiotherapy followed by total mesorectal excision (TME)?",
        options: {
          A: "The OPRA trial showed that TNT with selective WW provided comparable survival outcomes to standard chemoradiotherapy and TME.",
          B: "The OPRA trial demonstrated superior survival compared to historical standard-of-care treatments, proving that TNT should replace TME.",
          C: "Standard chemoradiotherapy followed by TME had significantly better DFS compared to TNT in the OPRA trial."
        },
        correct: "A",
        explanation: "The OPRA trial found that DFS and overall survival were comparable to historical data from standard CRT + TME, supporting the safety of TNT and WW without compromising oncologic outcomes."
