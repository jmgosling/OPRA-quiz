    const questions = [
      {
        question: "1. What was the primary rationale for investigating total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT) in rectal adenocarcinoma patients?",
        options: {
          A: "To eliminate the need for systemic chemotherapy in patients with a complete response.",
          B: "To improve compliance with systemic chemotherapy and treat micrometastasis earlier.",
          C: "To increase the likelihood of achieving a pathological complete response (pCR) compared to standard treatment."
        },
        correctAnswer: "B",
        explanation: "Explanation: The primary rationale for TNT was to enhance systemic chemotherapy compliance and target micrometastasis earlier in the disease course, potentially improving long-term outcomes and reducing recurrence risks."
      },
      {
        question: "2. Why was a “watch-and-wait” (WW) approach considered a feasible alternative in selected patients within the trial?",
        options: {
          A: "Because retrospective studies suggested that patients achieving clinical complete response (cCR) could safely avoid surgery.",
          B: "Because total mesorectal excision (TME) has been shown to provide no benefit in rectal adenocarcinoma treatment.",
          C: "Because the standard approach using neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy alone had a low pathological complete response rate."
        },
        correctAnswer: "A",
        explanation: "Explanation: Prior retrospective studies indicated that patients with cCR after neoadjuvant therapy had favorable long-term outcomes without surgery, supporting WW in carefully selected patients."
      },
      {
        question: "3. What was a key difference between the two treatment arms (INCT-CRT vs. CRT-CNCT) in this study?",
        options: {
          A: "INCT-CRT patients received chemoradiotherapy after systemic chemotherapy, while CRT-CNCT patients received chemoradiotherapy before systemic chemotherapy.",
          B: "INCT-CRT patients underwent immediate surgery, whereas CRT-CNCT patients followed a WW approach.",
          C: "CRT-CNCT patients received lower doses of chemotherapy compared to INCT-CRT patients."
        },
        correctAnswer: "A",
        explanation: "Explanation: The key distinction was the sequencing—one arm received induction chemotherapy before chemoradiotherapy (INCT-CRT), and the other received chemoradiotherapy before consolidation chemotherapy (CRT-CNCT)."
      },
      {
        question: "4. Which outcome measure was the primary endpoint for evaluating the efficacy of the TNT approach in this trial?",
        options: {
          A: "Overall survival (OS)",
          B: "Disease-free survival (DFS)",
          C: "Organ preservation rate"
        },
        correctAnswer: "B",
        explanation: "Explanation: The primary endpoint was disease-free survival (DFS) to compare outcomes against historical controls."
      },
      {
        question: "5. Based on the trial results, what was a key finding regarding disease-free survival (DFS) between the two TNT treatment arms?",
        options: {
          A: "DFS was significantly higher in the CRT-CNCT group compared to the INCT-CRT group.",
          B: "DFS was similar between the two groups and comparable to historical controls.",
          C: "Patients who received INCT-CRT had a significantly worse DFS than those in the CRT-CNCT group."
        },
        correctAnswer: "B",
        explanation: "Explanation: The study found no significant difference in DFS between the two groups, with both comparable to the historical 3-year DFS rate (approximately 75%)."
      },
      {
        question: "6. What was one major advantage of the CRT-CNCT regimen over INCT-CRT regarding organ preservation?",
        options: {
          A: "CRT-CNCT was associated with a higher proportion of patients maintaining rectal preservation compared to INCT-CRT.",
          B: "CRT-CNCT had significantly lower rates of tumor regrowth during the watch-and-wait period.",
          C: "Patients receiving CRT-CNCT had a lower incidence of adverse events compared to INCT-CRT."
        },
        correctAnswer: "A",
        explanation: "Explanation: The CRT-CNCT arm had a higher rate of organ preservation (53% vs. 41%), likely due to more patients achieving complete response before initiating WW."
      },
      {
        question: "7. Why was a non-inferiority trial comparing watch-and-wait (WW) with immediate total mesorectal excision (TME) not conducted in this study?",
        options: {
          A: "Because such a trial would be unlikely to accrue enough participants willing to randomize between surgery and WW.",
          B: "Because existing evidence had already established the superiority of WW over TME in rectal cancer treatment.",
          C: "Because it was unethical to withhold surgery from any rectal cancer patients achieving complete response."
        },
        correctAnswer: "A",
        explanation: "Explanation: A large non-inferiority trial randomizing patients to either TME or WW would be difficult to accrue, as many prefer organ preservation when safe."
      },
      // Group 2
      {
        question: "8. What was the rationale for using a phase II trial design instead of a phase III trial in the OPRA study?",
        options: {
          A: "The study aimed to generate preliminary efficacy data before conducting a larger, definitive trial.",
          B: "A phase III trial was deemed unnecessary because previous studies had already established the superiority of TNT over standard treatment.",
          C: "A phase III trial was not feasible due to the small patient population eligible for organ preservation strategies."
        },
        correctAnswer: "A",
        explanation: "Explanation: The study was designed as two standalone phase II trials to assess preliminary efficacy and feasibility before a potential phase III trial."
      },
      {
        question: "9. What was the primary stratification factor used during randomization in the OPRA trial?",
        options: {
          A: "Tumor stage (stage II vs. stage III)",
          B: "Participating institution",
          C: "Distance of the tumor from the anal verge"
        },
        correctAnswer: "B",
        explanation: "Explanation: Randomization was stratified by institution to ensure balanced treatment assignment across sites."
      },
      {
        question: "10. Why did the OPRA trial include both INCT-CRT and CRT-CNCT treatment sequences?",
        options: {
          A: "To compare the effectiveness of different sequencing strategies in achieving organ preservation and DFS.",
          B: "To determine whether one sequence resulted in fewer adverse events.",
          C: "To accommodate patient preference for different chemotherapy regimens."
        },
        correctAnswer: "A",
        explanation: "Explanation: The study evaluated whether induction chemotherapy before chemoradiotherapy (INCT-CRT) or chemoradiotherapy before consolidation chemotherapy (CRT-CNCT) led to better outcomes."
      },
      {
        question: "11. What was the total radiation dose delivered to the primary tumor and involved nodes in the OPRA trial?",

          C: "6,000 to 7,000 cGy"
        },
        correctAnswer: "B",
        explanation: "Explanation: Patients received 4,500 cGy to regional pelvic nodes and a total dose of 5,000–5,600 cGy to the primary tumor and involved nodes."
      },
      {
        question: "12. How was chemotherapy administered during chemoradiotherapy in the OPRA trial?",

          C: "As an oral metronomic dosing schedule to minimize toxicity."
        },
        correctAnswer: "B",
        explanation: "Explanation: During chemoradiotherapy, patients received either capecitabine or continuous infusion 5-FU, based on the oncologist’s preference."
      },
      {
        question: "13. What was the method used to assess tumor response before determining eligibility for watch-and-wait (WW) or surgery?",
        options: {
          A: "Pathologic evaluation of biopsy samples after chemoradiotherapy.",
          B: "A combination of digital rectal examination, endoscopy, MRI, and CT.",
          C: "Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis to detect minimal residual disease."
        },
        correctAnswer: "B",
        explanation: "Explanation: A multimodal approach including digital rectal examination, endoscopy, MRI, and CT was used to assess response."
      },
      {
        question: "14. How did the OPRA trial define disease-free survival (DFS), the primary endpoint?",
        options: {
          A: "The time from randomization to the first occurrence of locoregional failure, distant metastasis, new colorectal cancer, or death.",
          B: "The time from initiation of chemoradiotherapy to local recurrence or distant metastasis.",
          C: "The time from treatment completion to the first recurrence of rectal cancer."
        },
        correctAnswer: "A",
        explanation: "Explanation: DFS was measured from randomization until locoregional failure, distant metastasis, new colorectal primary, or death from any cause."
      },
      {
        question: "15. Why were patients with prior pelvic irradiation excluded from the OPRA trial?",
        options: {
          A: "Because prior irradiation could increase the risk of radiation toxicity and confound treatment effects.",
          B: "Because such patients typically have a higher likelihood of achieving a complete response to chemoradiotherapy.",
          C: "Because prior pelvic radiation makes surgery technically unfeasible."
        },
        correctAnswer: "A",
        explanation: "Explanation: Prior pelvic irradiation increases the risk of severe toxicity and confounds treatment response evaluation."
      },
      {
        question: "16. How did the OPRA trial account for differences in tumor response timing between the two treatment arms?",
        options: {
          A: "By using a standardized interval of 8 weeks after TNT completion for tumor restaging.",
          B: "By performing restaging at different time points depending on the treatment sequence.",
          C: "By requiring mandatory biopsies at multiple intervals to confirm response."
        },
        correctAnswer: "B",
        explanation: "Explanation: The CRT-CNCT group had a longer interval (approximately 28 weeks) from the end of chemoradiotherapy to restaging compared to the INCT-CRT group (8 weeks)."
      },
      {
        question: "17. What statistical method was used to compare DFS and TME-free survival between the treatment groups?",

        question: "19. Why were patients with sustained complete response (cCR) on WW followed with strict surveillance protocols?",
        options: {
          A: "To detect tumor regrowth early and recommend salvage TME if necessary.",
          B: "To confirm that organ preservation leads to a better quality of life without risk of recurrence.",
          C: "To determine if these patients could avoid further oncologic follow-up after two years."
        },
        correctAnswer: "A",
        explanation: "Explanation: Strict surveillance (every 4–6 months initially) was used to monitor for regrowth and allow timely intervention with TME if needed."
