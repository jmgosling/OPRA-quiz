        ],
        correct: 0,
        explanation: "This question focuses on the trial's main aim. The paper states: “Organ preservation is achievable in half of the patients with rectal cancer treated with total neoadjuvant therapy, without detriment in survival compared with historical controls.”"

        ],
        correct: 1,
        explanation: "‘Organ preservation’ refers to sparing the rectum. The concept is captured when the paper states, “Organ preservation is achievable in half of the patients…”"

      },
      {
        question: "12. What role does power analysis play in the trial design?",
        options: [
          "It ensures sample size is adequate to detect a difference in DFS.",
          "It determines study duration.",
          "It applies only to secondary outcomes."
        ],
        correct: 0,
        explanation: "Power analysis ensures the study can detect clinically meaningful differences. The paper required “101 patients evaluable for the primary end point per group to have 85% power.”"
      },

        ],
        correct: 0,
        explanation: "Matching is achieved by similar treatment protocols. The paper notes that “the proportion of patients receiving either [FOLFOX or CAPEOX] was similar in both groups.”"
      },
      {
        question: "19. What was the primary outcome measure in the OPRA trial?",

          "To complicate the study design."
        ],
        correct: 0,
        explanation: "Measuring both outcomes offers a full picture. The paper implies this by evaluating DFS and organ preservation to “provide additional context to the primary outcomes.”"
