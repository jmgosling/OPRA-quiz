];

// ==================== RAPIDO QUESTIONS ====================
/* 
  Source: Dijkstra et al. Ann Surg 2023;278:e766–e772
  Key Points:
    - Compares short-course RT + chemo (TNT) vs standard long-course chemoradiotherapy
    - At 5 years, better systemic control (fewer distant mets) with TNT, but slightly higher local recurrence
    - No difference in overall survival
*/

  {
    question: "2. Which two approaches did RAPIDO compare?",
    answers: [
      "Immediate surgery vs palliative care",
      "Short-course RT + chemo (TNT) vs standard long-course chemoradiotherapy (with optional postop chemo)",
      "Long-course RT + watch-and-wait only",
      "Proton therapy vs photon therapy",

    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "RAPIDO focused on locally advanced rectal cancers with high-risk features per MRI."
  },
  {
    question: "4. After 5 years, which outcome was significantly improved in the TNT (short-course RT + chemo) arm?",
    answers: [
      "Local recurrence was much lower",
      "Disease-related treatment failure (DrTF) and distant metastases were reduced",
      "Overall survival doubled",
      "No improvement was found",
      "Pathologic complete response was zero"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "The TNT approach lowered disease-related treatment failure and distant metastases at 5 years, even though local recurrence was modestly higher."
  },
  {
    question: "5. What happened to locoregional failure (LRF) at 5 years in the short-course RT + chemo group compared to standard?",
    answers: [
      "LRF was significantly lower",
      "LRF was the same in both arms",
      "Slightly higher LRF in the TNT group",
      "Nearly 100% local control in TNT",
      "Both arms had zero local recurrences"
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "Although the TNT approach improved systemic control, it led to a small but notable increase in local recurrence at 5 years."
  },
  {
    question: "6. Which factor contributed to the higher local recurrence in the TNT arm?",
    answers: [
      "Excessive immunotherapy use",
      "Major reduction in TME surgeries",

      "Inadequate follow-up protocols",
      "Massive variation in RT dose"
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "Data showed more mesorectal breaches and possible geometric misses with older 3D-CRT in the TNT group, raising local recurrence."
  },
  {
    question: "7. In RAPIDO, what is an 'early locoregional failure (eLRF)'?",
    answers: [
      "LRF after R0 resection and 2 years of follow-up",

      "No resection or an R2 resection in poor responders (often with distant mets)",
      "LRF discovered after 5 years post-TNT",
      "A trivial data point in the trial"
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "eLRF was defined as no (or R2) resection because the tumor was deemed unresectable or widely progressed before definitive surgery."
  },
  {
    question: "8. Which composite endpoint captured local and systemic progressions in RAPIDO?",
    answers: [
      "Overall stoma rate (OSR)",
      "Disease-related treatment failure (DrTF)",

      "Pathologic complete response (pCR)",
      "Time to local re-growth"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "The trial's primary endpoint was disease-related treatment failure, combining locoregional failure, distant mets, and new primaries or death."
  },
  {
    question: "9. At 5 years, how did overall survival (OS) compare between TNT and standard therapy in RAPIDO?",
    answers: [
      "TNT had significantly worse OS",
      "TNT significantly boosted OS",
      "No significant difference in OS",
      "OS was near 100% in both arms",
      "OS was unmeasured in the trial"
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "Despite improved distant control and a small rise in LRF, OS did not differ significantly between short-course TNT and standard therapy."
  },
  {
    question: "10. What key lesson can be drawn from RAPIDO for future rectal cancer management?",
    answers: [
      "Short-course RT + chemo improves systemic outcomes but local control must be carefully managed",
      "Long-course CRT is obsolete",
      "Neoadjuvant therapy has no role in advanced rectal cancer",
      "All patients should skip TME surgery",
      "A watch-and-wait policy was the main endpoint of RAPIDO"
    ],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "While TNT reduces metastases and DrTF, local recurrence can be slightly higher. The takeaway is to monitor local control carefully."

  },
  {
    question: "4. Did hyper-C improve overall outcomes compared to standard-C in the entire GRAALL-2005 population?",
    answers: [
      "Yes, significantly better EFS and OS",
      "It improved OS but not EFS",
      "It only lowered induction mortality",
      "No significant advantage was seen in the overall cohort",
      "It worsened treatment outcomes drastically"
    ],
    correct: 3,
    explanation: "Hyper-C did not yield a statistically significant benefit in EFS or OS across the entire study population."

    correct: 3,
    explanation: "Patients ≥ 55 had worse toxicity and higher treatment-related mortality, indicating poor tolerability to fully intensified protocols."
  },
  {
    question: "7. What was a notable result of hyper-C among patients ≥ 55 years in GRAALL-2005?",
    answers: [
      "They had drastically higher relapse rates",
      "They showed some improved outcomes compared to standard-C if their ALL was sensitive",
      "They derived no benefit at all",
      "They all died during induction",
      "They were excluded from the trial"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Post hoc analysis suggested older patients with chemo-sensitive ALL might see some benefit from early cyclophosphamide intensification."
  },
  {
    question: "8. How did the GRAALL-2005 define 'high-risk' ALL?",
    answers: [
      "Based solely on presence of the BCR-ABL fusion gene",
      "Any extramedullary disease",
      "A combination of poor early blast clearance, unfavorable cytogenetics (e.g. t(4;11)), or late CR",
      "Low white cell count at presentation",
      "Presence of minimal residual disease only"
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "High-risk included CNS involvement, poor early blast clearance, certain adverse cytogenetics (e.g., KMT2A), and the need for a second induction to achieve CR."
  },
  {
    question: "9. Why did the authors propose an age limit of 55 for using pediatric-derived protocols in adult ALL?",
    answers: [
      "Because the CR rate was zero in older patients",
      "To reduce asparaginase usage only",
      "Due to significantly higher toxicity and mortality in patients ≥ 55",
      "No patients older than 30 responded well in this trial",
      "They needed to limit insurance coverage"
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "Tolerance declines notably beyond 55, leading to higher rates of induction death and poor treatment compliance."
  },
  {
    question: "10. What is the take-home message of the GRAALL-2005 trial for UK consultants treating adult ALL?",
    answers: [
      "Pediatric-inspired therapy yields poor results for all adult patients",
      "Hyper-C dramatically benefits all adult ALL patients",
      "A pediatric-based approach is feasible for adults up to ~55, but older patients have high toxicity and minimal net benefit",
      "Long-term maintenance is unnecessary for adult ALL",
      "It is recommended to omit all allogeneic transplants in first remission"
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "GRAALL-2005 supports a pediatric-like regimen for younger adults. Past 55 years, toxicity rises and outcomes worsen, requiring adapted strategies."
