    // All questions array (51 questions) with text, options, correct answer and explanation.
    const questions = [
      {
        question: "1. What was the primary rationale for investigating total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT) in rectal adenocarcinoma patients?",
        options: {
          A: "To eliminate the need for systemic chemotherapy in patients with a complete response.",
          B: "To improve compliance with systemic chemotherapy and treat micrometastasis earlier.",
          C: "To increase the likelihood of achieving a pathological complete response (pCR) compared to standard treatment."
        },
        correct: "B",
        explanation: "The primary rationale for TNT was to enhance systemic chemotherapy compliance and target micrometastasis earlier in the disease course, rather than waiting until after surgery, thereby potentially improving long-term outcomes and reducing recurrence risks."
      },
      {
        question: "2. Why was a “watch-and-wait” (WW) approach considered a feasible alternative in selected patients within the trial?",
        options: {
          A: "Because retrospective studies suggested that patients achieving clinical complete response (cCR) could safely avoid surgery.",
          B: "Because total mesorectal excision (TME) has been shown to provide no benefit in rectal adenocarcinoma treatment.",
          C: "Because the standard approach using neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy alone had a low pathological complete response rate."
        },
        correct: "A",
        explanation: "Prior retrospective studies indicated that patients with cCR after neoadjuvant therapy had favorable long-term outcomes without surgery, supporting the feasibility of a WW strategy in carefully selected patients."
      },
      {
        question: "3. What was a key difference between the two treatment arms (INCT-CRT vs. CRT-CNCT) in this study?",
        options: {
          A: "INCT-CRT patients received chemoradiotherapy after systemic chemotherapy, while CRT-CNCT patients received chemoradiotherapy before systemic chemotherapy.",
          B: "INCT-CRT patients underwent immediate surgery, whereas CRT-CNCT patients followed a WW approach.",
          C: "CRT-CNCT patients received lower doses of chemotherapy compared to INCT-CRT patients."
        },
        correct: "A",
        explanation: "The key distinction was the sequencing of treatment—one arm received induction chemotherapy before chemoradiotherapy (INCT-CRT), and the other received chemoradiotherapy before consolidation chemotherapy (CRT-CNCT)."
      },
      {
        question: "4. Which outcome measure was the primary endpoint for evaluating the efficacy of the TNT approach in this trial?",
        options: {
          A: "Overall survival (OS)",
          B: "Disease-free survival (DFS)",
          C: "Organ preservation rate"
        },
        correct: "B",
        explanation: "The study was designed as two standalone phase II trials, with disease-free survival (DFS) as the primary endpoint to compare outcomes against historical controls."
      },
      {
        question: "5. Based on the trial results, what was a key finding regarding disease-free survival (DFS) between the two TNT treatment arms?",
        options: {
          A: "DFS was significantly higher in the CRT-CNCT group compared to the INCT-CRT group.",
          B: "DFS was similar between the two groups and comparable to historical controls.",
          C: "Patients who received INCT-CRT had a significantly worse DFS than those in the CRT-CNCT group."
        },
        correct: "B",
        explanation: "The study found no significant difference in DFS between the two groups, and both were comparable to the 3-year DFS rate observed historically (approximately 75%)."
      },
      {
        question: "6. What was one major advantage of the CRT-CNCT regimen over INCT-CRT regarding organ preservation?",
        options: {
          A: "CRT-CNCT was associated with a higher proportion of patients maintaining rectal preservation compared to INCT-CRT.",
          B: "CRT-CNCT had significantly lower rates of tumor regrowth during the watch-and-wait period.",
          C: "Patients receiving CRT-CNCT had a lower incidence of adverse events compared to INCT-CRT."
        },
        correct: "A",
        explanation: "The CRT-CNCT arm had a higher rate of organ preservation (53% vs. 41% in INCT-CRT), likely due to a higher proportion of patients achieving complete response before WW was initiated."
      },
      {
        question: "7. Why was a non-inferiority trial comparing watch-and-wait (WW) with immediate total mesorectal excision (TME) not conducted in this study?",
        options: {
          A: "Because such a trial would be unlikely to accrue enough participants willing to randomize between surgery and WW.",
          B: "Because existing evidence had already established the superiority of WW over TME in rectal cancer treatment.",
          C: "Because it was unethical to withhold surgery from any rectal cancer patients achieving complete response."
        },
        correct: "A",
        explanation: "A large non-inferiority trial randomizing patients to either TME or WW after achieving cCR would be difficult to accrue, as many patients and clinicians prefer organ preservation if deemed safe."
      },
      // Block 2 – OPRA trial design (Questions 8–19)
      {
        question: "8. What was the rationale for using a phase II trial design instead of a phase III trial in the OPRA study?",
        options: {
          A: "The study aimed to generate preliminary efficacy data before conducting a larger, definitive trial.",
          B: "A phase III trial was deemed unnecessary because previous studies had already established the superiority of TNT over standard treatment.",
          C: "A phase III trial was not feasible due to the small patient population eligible for organ preservation strategies."
        },
        correct: "A",
        explanation: "The study was designed as two standalone phase II trials to assess preliminary efficacy and feasibility before potentially advancing to a larger phase III trial."
      },
      {
        question: "9. What was the primary stratification factor used during randomization in the OPRA trial?",
        options: {
          A: "Tumor stage (stage II vs. stage III)",
          B: "Participating institution",
          C: "Distance of the tumor from the anal verge"
        },
        correct: "B",
        explanation: "Patients were randomized using the method of random permuted blocks, stratified by institution, to ensure balanced treatment assignment across sites."
      },
      {
        question: "10. Why did the OPRA trial include both INCT-CRT and CRT-CNCT treatment sequences?",
        options: {
          A: "To compare the effectiveness of different sequencing strategies in achieving organ preservation and disease-free survival.",
          B: "To determine whether one sequence resulted in fewer adverse events.",
          C: "To accommodate patient preference for different chemotherapy regimens."
        },
        correct: "A",
        explanation: "The study was designed to evaluate whether induction chemotherapy before chemoradiotherapy (INCT-CRT) or chemoradiotherapy before consolidation chemotherapy (CRT-CNCT) led to better organ preservation and DFS outcomes."
      },
      {
        question: "11. What was the total radiation dose delivered to the primary tumor and involved nodes in the OPRA trial?",
        options: {
          A: "3,600 to 4,200 cGy",
          B: "4,500 to 5,600 cGy",
          C: "6,000 to 7,000 cGy"
        },
        correct: "B",
        explanation: "Patients received 4,500 cGy to regional pelvic nodes, with a total dose of 5,000-5,600 cGy delivered to the primary tumor and involved nodes using a sequential or integrated boost strategy."
      },
      {
        question: "12. How was chemotherapy administered during chemoradiotherapy in the OPRA trial?",
        options: {
          A: "As bolus intravenous 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) once weekly during radiation.",
          B: "As capecitabine (825 mg/m² twice daily) or continuous infusion 5-FU (225 mg/m² per day).",
          C: "As an oral metronomic dosing schedule to minimize toxicity."
        },
        correct: "B",
        explanation: "During chemoradiotherapy, patients received either capecitabine or continuous infusion 5-FU, depending on the preference of their medical oncologist."
      },
      {
        question: "13. What was the method used to assess tumor response before determining eligibility for watch-and-wait (WW) or surgery?",
        options: {
          A: "Pathologic evaluation of biopsy samples after chemoradiotherapy.",
          B: "A combination of digital rectal examination, endoscopy, MRI, and CT.",
          C: "Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis to detect minimal residual disease."
        },
        correct: "B",
        explanation: "Tumor response was assessed using a multi-modal approach that included digital rectal examination, endoscopic examination, MRI, and CT scans to determine complete or near-complete response."
      },
      {
        question: "14. How did the OPRA trial define disease-free survival (DFS), the primary endpoint?",
        options: {
          A: "The time from randomization to the first occurrence of locoregional failure, distant metastasis, new colorectal cancer, or death.",
          B: "The time from initiation of chemoradiotherapy to local recurrence or distant metastasis.",
          C: "The time from treatment completion to the first recurrence of rectal cancer."
        },
        correct: "A",
        explanation: "DFS was measured from randomization until locoregional failure, distant metastasis, the development of a new colorectal primary cancer, or death from any cause."
      },
      {
        question: "15. Why were patients with prior pelvic irradiation excluded from the OPRA trial?",
        options: {
          A: "Because prior irradiation could increase the risk of radiation toxicity and confound treatment effects.",
          B: "Because such patients typically have a higher likelihood of achieving a complete response to chemoradiotherapy.",
          C: "Because prior pelvic radiation makes surgery technically unfeasible."
        },
        correct: "A",
        explanation: "Prior pelvic irradiation increases the risk of severe toxicity and confounds treatment response, making it difficult to evaluate the efficacy of TNT and organ preservation strategies."
      },
      {
        question: "16. How did the OPRA trial account for differences in tumor response timing between the two treatment arms?",
        options: {
          A: "By using a standardized interval of 8 weeks after TNT completion for tumor restaging.",
          B: "By performing restaging at different time points depending on the treatment sequence.",
          C: "By requiring mandatory biopsies at multiple intervals to confirm response."
        },
        correct: "B",
        explanation: "The CRT-CNCT group had a longer interval from the end of chemoradiotherapy to restaging (approximately 28 weeks), compared to the INCT-CRT group (8 weeks), due to the sequence of chemotherapy administration."
      },
      {
        question: "17. What statistical method was used to compare DFS and TME-free survival between the treatment groups?",
        options: {
          A: "Kaplan-Meier survival analysis with Cox regression models.",
          B: "Bayesian hierarchical modeling to adjust for patient heterogeneity.",
          C: "Logistic regression with propensity score matching."
        },
        correct: "A",
        explanation: "The study used Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox regression models to compare DFS and TME-free survival, adjusting for relevant clinical factors."
      },
      {
        question: "18. What was the key reason why DFS did not significantly improve in the OPRA trial compared to historical controls?",
        options: {
          A: "Differences in patient selection criteria between the OPRA trial and historical cohorts.",
          B: "TNT may not provide a DFS benefit over standard chemoradiotherapy, TME, and postoperative chemotherapy.",
          C: "Organ preservation in the WW cohort led to increased rates of distant metastases."
        },
        correct: "B",
        explanation: "The study found no DFS benefit for TNT compared to historical controls, suggesting that TNT alone may not improve DFS over standard chemoradiotherapy, TME, and postoperative chemotherapy."
      },
      {
        question: "19. Why were patients with sustained complete response (cCR) on WW followed with strict surveillance protocols?",
        options: {
          A: "To detect tumor regrowth early and recommend salvage TME if necessary.",
          B: "To confirm that organ preservation leads to a better quality of life without risk of recurrence.",
          C: "To determine if these patients could avoid further oncologic follow-up after two years."
        },
        correct: "A",
        explanation: "WW patients were followed with frequent surveillance (every 4-6 months for 2 years, then less frequently), to monitor for tumor regrowth and intervene with TME if necessary."
      },
      // Block 3 – OPRA trial outcomes (Questions 20–31)
      {
        question: "20. What was the 3-year disease-free survival (DFS) rate in the OPRA trial for both treatment groups?",
        options: {
          A: "85% for INCT-CRT and 78% for CRT-CNCT.",
          B: "76% for INCT-CRT and 76% for CRT-CNCT.",
          C: "70% for INCT-CRT and 80% for CRT-CNCT."
        },
        correct: "B",
        explanation: "The study reported a 3-year DFS of 76% in both groups, showing that sequencing of TNT did not affect DFS outcomes when compared to historical controls."
      },
      {
        question: "21. How did the organ preservation rates compare between the two treatment arms?",
        options: {
          A: "The CRT-CNCT group had significantly higher organ preservation rates than the INCT-CRT group.",
          B: "The INCT-CRT group had significantly higher organ preservation rates than the CRT-CNCT group.",
          C: "Organ preservation rates were similar between both treatment arms."
        },
        correct: "A",
        explanation: "Organ preservation was higher in the CRT-CNCT group (53%) compared to INCT-CRT (41%), likely due to the prolonged time interval between chemoradiotherapy and restaging, allowing for greater tumor regression."
      },
      {
        question: "22. What was the main factor associated with achieving organ preservation in the OPRA trial?",
        options: {
          A: "Longer interval between completion of chemoradiotherapy and tumor restaging.",
          B: "The use of induction chemotherapy before chemoradiotherapy.",
          C: "The use of capecitabine rather than infusional fluorouracil during radiation therapy."
        },
        correct: "A",
        explanation: "Patients in the CRT-CNCT group (which had a longer interval from chemoradiotherapy to restaging) had higher rates of organ preservation, supporting the hypothesis that delaying assessment increases response rates."
      },
      {
        question: "23. What proportion of patients in the OPRA trial ultimately underwent total mesorectal excision (TME)?",
        options: {
          A: "25%",
          B: "50%",
          C: "60%"
        },
        correct: "B",
        explanation: "Approximately half of the patients ultimately underwent TME, either due to incomplete response at restaging or tumor regrowth after watch-and-wait."
      },
      {
        question: "24. What was the estimated rate of tumor regrowth among patients who initially followed a watch-and-wait (WW) approach?",
        options: {
          A: "40% in the INCT-CRT group and 27% in the CRT-CNCT group.",
          B: "25% in both treatment arms.",
          C: "50% in the INCT-CRT group and 35% in the CRT-CNCT group."
        },
        correct: "A",
        explanation: "The INCT-CRT group had a higher tumor regrowth rate (40%) compared to the CRT-CNCT group (27%), suggesting that the sequence of treatment influences long-term tumor control."
      },
      {
        question: "25. How did the overall survival (OS) outcomes compare between the INCT-CRT and CRT-CNCT groups?",
        options: {
          A: "The CRT-CNCT group had significantly higher OS than the INCT-CRT group.",
          B: "The INCT-CRT group had significantly higher OS than the CRT-CNCT group.",
          C: "Overall survival was similar between both groups."
        },
        correct: "C",
        explanation: "The study found no significant difference in overall survival between the two treatment arms, indicating that both sequencing approaches were equally effective in long-term survival."
      },
      {
        question: "26. Among patients who underwent surgery after initial watch-and-wait, how did their disease-free survival (DFS) compare to those who had surgery immediately after neoadjuvant therapy?",
        options: {
          A: "DFS was significantly worse for those who had delayed surgery.",
          B: "DFS was comparable between both groups.",
          C: "DFS was significantly better for those who had delayed surgery."
        },
        correct: "B",
        explanation: "Patients who underwent TME after tumor regrowth had DFS rates similar to those who had surgery immediately after neoadjuvant therapy, suggesting that delayed surgery after initial WW does not compromise long-term outcomes."
      },
      {
        question: "27. What was the rate of local recurrence-free survival at 3 years in the OPRA trial?",
        options: {
          A: "94% for both treatment arms.",
          B: "80% for INCT-CRT and 90% for CRT-CNCT.",
          C: "70% for both treatment arms."
        },
        correct: "A",
        explanation: "The study found high rates of local recurrence-free survival (94%) in both groups, supporting the safety of a watch-and-wait approach for carefully selected patients."

      {
        question: "28. What was the most common type of recurrence observed in the OPRA trial?",
        options: {
          A: "Distant metastasis.",
          B: "Local recurrence in the rectum.",
          C: "New primary colorectal tumors."
        },
        correct: "A",
        explanation: "Distant metastasis was the most common recurrence event, occurring in 41 patients, reinforcing the importance of systemic control in rectal cancer treatment."
      },
      {
        question: "29. How did the use of non-operative management (WW) impact sphincter preservation rates in the OPRA trial?",
        options: {
          A: "Sphincter preservation was significantly higher in patients who followed WW compared to those who underwent immediate surgery.",
          B: "Sphincter preservation rates were the same between WW patients and those who had immediate surgery.",
          C: "Patients who underwent surgery after WW had lower sphincter preservation rates than those who had immediate surgery."
        },
        correct: "A",
        explanation: "WW patients had significantly higher sphincter preservation rates, as avoiding TME prevented the need for permanent colostomies in many cases."
      },

According to OPRA trial findings, which approach is more likely to result in organ preservation?",
        options: {
          A: "CRT-CNCT, as it was associated with a higher rate of sustained clinical complete response and rectal preservation.",
          B: "INCT-CRT, as delivering chemotherapy before chemoradiotherapy increases response rates.",
          C: "Both approaches result in equivalent organ preservation rates, so the decision should be based on patient preference."
        },
        correct: "A",
        explanation: "The CRT-CNCT arm had a higher rate of organ preservation (53%) compared to INCT-CRT (41%), likely due to the prolonged time interval allowing for greater tumor regression."
