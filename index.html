// CORRECTED RAPIDO 5-Year Follow-up Quiz (27 questions):
const questionsRapido = [
  {
    question: "1) Which primary clinical challenge in locally advanced rectal cancer motivated the concept of total neoadjuvant treatment (TNT) in the RAPIDO trial?",
    options: [
      "A. The high rate of distant metastasis despite improved local control",
      "B. The need to offer shorter, non-surgical treatment for rectal cancer",
      "C. A desire to replace all radiation with purely systemic chemotherapy"
    ],
    correctIndex: 0,
    explanation: "Correct Answer: A\nEven though local control improved significantly after the introduction of preoperative RT and TME, distant metastases remained a persistent problem. TNT was introduced to reduce systemic relapse."
  },
  {
    question: "2) One key reason short-course radiotherapy (scRT) was selected for the experimental arm was:",
    options: [
      "A. To provide a lesser biologically effective dose than long-course chemoradiotherapy",
      "B. To enable a faster transition to systemic chemotherapy",
      "C. To maintain local control while delaying surgery indefinitely"
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: "Correct Answer: B\nShort-course RT shortens the time to full-dose chemotherapy, aligning with the TNT concept to tackle micrometastatic disease earlier."
  },
  {
    question: "3) In the context of the RAPIDO trial’s rationale, what was the primary goal of administering systemic chemotherapy before surgery?",
    options: [
      "A. To eliminate any need for TME surgery",
      "B. To prevent local recurrences in the pelvis",
      "C. To improve control of micrometastatic disease and thus reduce distant metastases"
    ],
    correctIndex: 2,
    explanation: "Correct Answer: C\nSystemic chemotherapy early on was meant to reduce the overall risk of distant spread, the main cause of treatment failure."
  },
  {
    question: "4) Which baseline high-risk features on MRI qualified patients for enrollment in the RAPIDO trial?",
    options: [
      "A. cT4, cN2, EMVI+, enlarged lateral lymph nodes, and/or threatened mesorectal fascia",
      "B. Any rectal cancer located 0–16 cm from the anal verge, regardless of staging",
      "C. Low-grade adenomas of the rectum with negative lymph nodes"
    ],
    correctIndex: 0,
    explanation: "Correct Answer: A\nPatients needed at least one high-risk MRI finding (cT4, N2, EMVI+, large lateral nodes, or MRF+)."
  },
  {
    question: "5) In the experimental (EXP) arm, what was the sequence of treatments?",
    options: [
      "A. Chemotherapy → Total mesorectal excision (TME) → Long-course radiotherapy",
      "B. Short-course radiotherapy → Preoperative chemotherapy → Surgery",
      "C. Long-course chemoradiotherapy → Surgery → Mandatory adjuvant chemotherapy"
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: "Correct Answer: B\nThe EXP arm used TNT: 5×5 Gy RT, then CAPOX/FOLFOX4, then TME surgery."
  },
  {
    question: "6) In the standard-care (STD) arm of the RAPIDO trial, patients could receive postoperative chemotherapy based on:",
    options: [
      "A. Mandatory enrollment in a second randomized trial",
      "B. Discretion of the treating center, per protocol allowance",
      "C. A universal requirement that all patients complete six cycles of CAPOX"
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: "Correct Answer: B\nLong-course chemoradiotherapy was followed by surgery, and postoperative chemotherapy (8 cycles CAPOX or 12 FOLFOX4) was optional per hospital policy, though strongly recommended."
  },
  {
    question: "7) How was tumor response assessed in the RAPIDO trial before TME surgery?",
    options: [
      "A. Radiologic restaging (MRI ± CT) ~1–2 weeks pre-surgery",
      "B. Only a baseline CT scan of the thorax and abdomen was done, without further imaging",
      "C. Intraoperative frozen sections of the tumor were the sole method of response assessment"
    ],
    correctIndex: 0,
    explanation: "Correct Answer: A\nPatients underwent MRI of the pelvis and CT of the thorax/abdomen for restaging before surgery, consistent with standard protocols."
  },
  {
    question: "8) Which statement best reflects the radiation techniques used in the RAPIDO trial?",
    options: [
      "A. All sites exclusively used volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) to deliver scRT",
      "B. Both 3D-CRT and IMRT/VMAT were permitted, depending on each center’s protocols",
      "C. Radiation technique was standardized to conventional two-field planning in all centers"
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: "Correct Answer: B\nCenters used various approaches; IMRT/VMAT was commonly used in long-course CRT, while 3D-CRT was typical for short-course RT."
  },
  {
    question: "9) Which best describes the surgical procedure mandated by the protocol for most patients in both arms?",
    options: [
      "A. Radical local excision without mesorectal resection",
      "B. Standardized total mesorectal excision (TME)",
      "C. Sphincter-saving resection only if a complete clinical response was confirmed"
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: "Correct Answer: B\nTME was the standard surgical approach for resectable disease, with the choice of sphincter-saving or APR depending on tumor location and response."
  },
  {
    question: "10) At a median follow-up of about 5.6 years, which statement accurately reflects the difference in locoregional failure (LRF) between arms?",
    options: [
      "A. LRF was numerically higher in the EXP arm (12%) vs. STD (8%), approaching but not reaching significance",
      "B. There was no difference in LRF rates; both arms had 10%",
      "C. The EXP arm demonstrated a significantly lower LRF rate than STD"
    ],
    correctIndex: 0,
    explanation: "Correct Answer: A\nLRF was 11.7% (EXP) vs. 8.1% (STD) at five years (P=0.07), slightly favoring the STD arm."
  },
  {
    question: "11) Regarding early locoregional failures (eLRF), defined as no resection or R2 resection (except organ preservation):",
    options: [
      "A. eLRFs were over three times higher in the EXP arm",
      "B. Both arms showed similarly low rates of eLRF, often accompanied by distant metastases",
      "C. eLRFs were only seen in STD patients since they waited longer before surgery"
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: "Correct Answer: B\neLRFs were rare and occurred at similar rates (10 patients each arm). Most eLRF cases also had distant metastases."
  },
  {
    question: "12) When focusing on locoregional recurrence (LRR) after an R0/R1 resection, what was observed in the EXP arm vs. STD?",
    options: [
      "A. Identical LRR rates (~6%) in both arms",
      "B. A strong reduction in LRR in the EXP arm thanks to chemo",
      "C. A significantly higher LRR rate in the EXP group (10.2%) vs. STD (6.1%)"
    ],
    correctIndex: 2,
    explanation: "Correct Answer: C\nLRR was indeed higher in the EXP group (10.2% vs. 6.1%)."
  },
  {
    question: "13) Which factor was associated with an increased risk of LRR in patients receiving the experimental treatment?",
    options: [
      "A. Use of 3D-conformal RT instead of IMRT/VMAT",
      "B. Tumor location in the upper rectum (>12 cm from the anal verge)",
      "C. Absence of baseline EMVI"
    ],
    correctIndex: 0,
    explanation: "Correct Answer: A\nIn the EXP group, 3D-CRT correlated with higher LRR, possibly due to coverage or planning differences."
  },
  {
    question: "14) Which outcome did the five-year follow-up confirm regarding disease-related treatment failure (DrTF) and distant metastases (DM)?",
    options: [
      "A. No difference in DrTF or DM was detectable at five years",
      "B. Both DrTF and DM were significantly lower in the EXP arm at five years",
      "C. DM was higher in the EXP arm compared to STD at five years"
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: "Correct Answer: B\nEven at five years, DrTF and DM remained significantly lower in the EXP arm."
  },
  {
    question: "15) In terms of overall survival (OS) at five years, what was reported?",
    options: [
      "A. The EXP arm had clearly superior overall survival",
      "B. The STD arm had substantially better five-year OS",
      "C. There was no statistically significant difference between EXP and STD arms"
    ],
    correctIndex: 2,
    explanation: "Correct Answer: C\nNo significant OS difference emerged (81.7% vs. 80.2%; P=0.50)."
  },
  {
    question: "16) Which of the following is most clearly a strength of this trial?",
    options: [
      "A. It enrolled a large, international cohort of high-risk rectal cancer patients with robust imaging and follow-up",
      "B. It had a single-center design, ensuring strict uniformity of treatment",
      "C. The short follow-up period allowed quick conclusions about late recurrences"
    ],
    correctIndex: 0,
    explanation: "Correct Answer: A\nRAPIDO was a large, multicenter international study, making results generalizable for high-risk rectal cancer."
  },
  {
    question: "17) Which limitation might partly explain the higher LRR in the experimental group?",
    options: [
      "A. Overly aggressive surgical techniques in the EXP group",
      "B. Variability in radiation techniques (3D-CRT vs. IMRT/VMAT) without centralized RT quality control",
      "C. A requirement that all centers use exactly the same chemotherapy regimen"
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: "Correct Answer: B\nOne potential limitation is that scRT was more commonly planned with 3D-CRT, which may have led to more geographic misses and higher LRR."
  },
  {
    question: "18) One recognized shortcoming in analyzing LRR and LRF in the five-year results was:",
    options: [
      "A. The lack of any restaging imaging to confirm local recurrence",
      "B. The trial was underpowered for these secondary endpoints",
      "C. All LRR events were assumed to be in the anastomotic region"
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: "Correct Answer: B\nThe trial was not powered for LRF/LRR analyses, making definitive conclusions about local failure rates more challenging."
  },
  {
    question: "19) What does the study imply about the use of TNT (short-course RT + chemo) in rectal cancer care?",
    options: [
      "A. It confirms TNT’s ability to substantially reduce distant metastases while marginally risking higher local recurrences",
      "B. It recommends abandoning TNT altogether due to increased local failure",
      "C. It shows that TNT is only beneficial in early-stage rectal cancer"
    ],
    correctIndex: 0,
    explanation: "Correct Answer: A\nTNT reduces DM significantly but may have a slightly higher LRR risk, requiring careful technique."
  },
  {
    question: "20) Given the findings, how might clinicians mitigate the risk of local recurrence when using TNT?",
    options: [
      "A. By postponing all imaging and proceeding directly to surgery after chemotherapy",
      "B. By performing interim MRI evaluations and ensuring optimal RT technique and mesorectal dissection quality",
      "C. By removing all lateral pelvic lymph nodes prophylactically in every rectal cancer case"
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: "Correct Answer: B\nMonitoring response and refining radiotherapy and surgery can reduce locoregional failures."
  },
  {
    question: "21) Why might results at five years still justify TNT approaches in some centers despite an increased LRR rate?",
    options: [
      "A. Because local recurrence rates do not matter in rectal cancer",
      "B. Because significantly fewer distant metastases can outweigh a modest increase in LRR if local treatment is optimized",
      "C. Because the short-course RT regimen completely prevents anastomotic breakdown"
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: "Correct Answer: B\nTNT’s systemic benefits (reduced DM) are crucial. Many centers accept a slightly higher local recurrence if overall outcomes improve, especially with refined local therapy."
  },
  {
    question: "22) In a patient with cT3N2 rectal cancer and no sign of distant disease, how might the RAPIDO results guide therapy?",
    options: [
      "A. Consider short-course radiotherapy followed by chemotherapy, then carefully re-assess for surgery",
      "B. Start with immediate surgery to remove the primary tumor as soon as possible",
      "C. Omit local radiotherapy because TNT alone is enough for local control"
    ],
    correctIndex: 0,
    explanation: "Correct Answer: A\nTNT can address both local and systemic risk factors in cT3N2 disease; short-course RT plus chemo, then re-assessment, is a valid approach."
  },
  {
    question: "23) A patient on the EXP regimen shows poor tumor response mid-chemotherapy. What lesson from the trial might inform next steps?",
    options: [
      "A. Abandon all chemotherapy and consider best supportive care",
      "B. Perform an interim restaging, and if progression is suspected, expedite surgery or adapt therapy",
      "C. Continue the entire planned chemotherapy before evaluating any surgical option"
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: "Correct Answer: B\nIdentifying non-responders early may help avert local progression by moving to surgery sooner or changing strategy."
  },
  {
    question: "24) In patients for whom short-course RT is planned, what practical change might improve locoregional control according to the RAPIDO authors?",
    options: [
      "A. Using partial rather than whole-pelvis RT",
      "B. Shortening the total mesorectal excision plane",
      "C. Optimizing RT planning (IMRT/VMAT) to reduce geographic misses"
    ],
    correctIndex: 2,
    explanation: "Correct Answer: C\nBetter RT planning (e.g. IMRT/VMAT) may reduce LRR by avoiding under-coverage of the target area."
  },
  {
    question: "25) How do RAPIDO’s results compare with historical trials like Polish II and TROG concerning short-course vs. long-course RT?",
    options: [
      "A. RAPIDO is unique in adding full-dose chemotherapy preoperatively, showing improved systemic control beyond those earlier comparisons",
      "B. RAPIDO used the exact same protocol as Polish II, so the conclusions overlap completely",
      "C. Earlier studies found long-course RT was always superior to short-course in all endpoints"
    ],
    correctIndex: 0,
    explanation: "Correct Answer: A\nRAPIDO combined scRT with upfront full chemotherapy. Previous short-/long-course comparisons lacked this comprehensive TNT approach."
  },
  {
    question: "26) In comparison to the PRODIGE 23 trial, which also utilized a TNT approach, RAPIDO is distinct because:",
    options: [
      "A. It only studied metastatic rectal cancer",
      "B. It employed short-course RT and immediate chemotherapy, whereas PRODIGE 23 used long-course chemoradiotherapy within TNT",
      "C. It required 12 months of consecutive chemotherapy in all patients"
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: "Correct Answer: B\nRAPIDO gave 5×5 Gy followed by chemo, while PRODIGE 23 used a different sequence (long-course CRT plus induction chemo)."
  },
  {
    question: "27) What key message might a meta-analysis of RAPIDO and similar TNT studies highlight?",
    options: [
      "A. TNT should be avoided in high-risk rectal cancer",
      "B. TNT always leads to excessive toxicity with no improvement in outcomes",
      "C. TNT can improve systemic disease control but needs refinements to optimize local control"
    ],
    correctIndex: 2,
    explanation: "Correct Answer: C\nTNT lowers distant relapses, but local control strategies (RT, surgery technique) must be carefully refined."

// CORRECTED OPRA Trial Quiz (29 questions):
const questionsOpra = [
  // I. Background & Rationale
  {
    question: "1) What was one of the key motivations for investigating “watch-and-wait” (WW) strategies in the OPRA Trial?",
    options: [
      "A. To eliminate the need for systemic chemotherapy in low-risk rectal cancer",
      "B. To preserve organ function in patients who achieve a complete clinical response",
      "C. To test whether shorter radiation schedules could replace standard long-course RT"
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: "Correct Answer: B\nA main rationale was that many post-treatment sequelae (e.g. stoma, bowel dysfunction) are tied to surgery itself. For patients achieving complete or near-complete clinical response, avoiding TME can preserve quality of life."
  },
  {
    question: "2) Prior research on nonoperative management (NOM) strategies suggested what about patients with a complete clinical response (cCR)?",
    options: [
      "A. They always experience worse DFS than operated patients",
      "B. They can safely be observed without the need for long-term imaging",
      "C. They may achieve survival outcomes similar to those who undergo surgery"
    ],
    correctIndex: 2,
    explanation: "Correct Answer: C\nRetrospective and prospective data indicate that cCR patients can have comparable oncologic outcomes to surgical patients, prompting prospective trials like OPRA."
  },
  {
    question: "3) Why was the concept of total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT) integral to the OPRA Trial design?",
    options: [
      "A. It aimed to optimize both local and systemic control before considering surgery",
      "B. To avoid any form of radiotherapy prior to TME",
      "C. Because prior studies had shown that surgery alone suffices for T4 lesions"
    ],
    correctIndex: 0,
    explanation: "Correct Answer: A\nDelivering chemotherapy and chemoradiotherapy preoperatively was crucial to improving downstaging and tackling micrometastases before deciding on TME vs. WW."
  },
  // II. Study Design & Methods
  {
    question: "4) Which best describes the OPRA Trial’s randomization arms?",
    options: [
      "A. Induction chemotherapy (FOLFIRI) vs. induction chemotherapy (CAPEOX)",
      "B. Induction chemotherapy → chemoradiotherapy (INCT-CRT) vs. chemoradiotherapy → consolidation chemotherapy (CRT-CNCT)",
      "C. Two different schedules of low-dose radiotherapy before immediate TME"
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: "Correct Answer: B\nPatients were randomized to either systemic chemotherapy first (INCT-CRT) or chemoradiotherapy first (CRT-CNCT), both followed by restaging to decide TME or WW."
  },
  {
    question: "5) In the OPRA protocol, how was a “clinical complete response” (cCR) defined at restaging?",
    options: [
      "A. Tumor visible endoscopically but stable in size for at least 12 months",
      "B. Persistent ulceration or nodularity on MRI but negative endoscopic biopsy",
      "C. No visible tumor on endoscopy plus radiologic normalization/near-normalization on MRI"
    ],
    correctIndex: 2,
    explanation: "Correct Answer: C\ncCR required no visible tumor endoscopically (often just a faint scar) plus near-complete or complete resolution on MRI."
  },
  {
    question: "6) How many cycles of preoperative systemic chemotherapy were typically delivered in each OPRA arm, assuming FOLFOX was used?",
    options: [
      "A. Eight cycles",
      "B. Four cycles",
      "C. Twelve cycles"
    ],
    correctIndex: 0,
    explanation: "Correct Answer: A\nThe OPRA Trial used eight FOLFOX cycles (or five CAPEOX cycles) as either induction or consolidation around the chemoradiotherapy."
  },
  {
    question: "7) Concerning radiation therapy, which statement best reflects the dosing schema in OPRA?",
    options: [
      "A. All patients received a single 5×5 Gy short-course, then surgery",
      "B. Patients received approximately 50–56 Gy of pelvic RT, with either infusion 5-FU or oral capecitabine as a radiosensitizer",
      "C. Radiation to the primary tumor site was optional unless restaging showed poor response"
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: "Correct Answer: B\nThey generally received 4,500 cGy plus a boost (up to ~5,400–5,600 cGy), with concurrent infusion 5-FU or capecitabine."
  },
  {
    question: "8) Which best characterizes the timing of surgery decisions in OPRA?",
    options: [
      "A. Surgery was mandatory at a fixed 6 weeks after chemoradiotherapy in all patients",
      "B. TME was done only if the patient refused further surveillance after induction therapy",
      "C. Post-TNT restaging determined whether the patient would have TME immediately or be observed (WW) if cCR/near-cCR was achieved"
    ],
    correctIndex: 2,
    explanation: "Correct Answer: C\nAfter the full neoadjuvant course, patients who had incomplete response were advised TME, while cCR/near-cCR patients were eligible for WW."
  },
  {
    question: "9) Which requirement was crucial for follow-up of WW patients in the OPRA Trial?",
    options: [
      "A. Serial endoscopy and MRI every 4–6 months, especially in the first 2 years",
      "B. Yearly endoscopic evaluation only after 3 years",
      "C. An extra course of radiotherapy if there was near-complete response"
    ],
    correctIndex: 0,
    explanation: "Correct Answer: A\nFrequent endoscopy plus MRI scans were key to detect early regrowth. Intervals were especially tight in the first 24 months."

  {
    question: "10) What was the OPRA Trial’s primary endpoint, and how did its results compare to historical data?",
    options: [
      "A. Overall survival (OS) was significantly higher than in historical cohorts",
      "B. 3-year disease-free survival (DFS) was about 76%, similar to historical 75%",
      "C. 5-year locoregional control was the main measure, surpassing historical rates"
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: "Correct Answer: B\nThe primary endpoint was 3-year DFS (~76%), close to the historical reference of 75%, thus not statistically surpassing it."
  },
  {
    question: "11) How did the proportion of patients achieving organ preservation (i.e., TME-free survival at 3 years) differ between the two TNT arms?",
    options: [
      "A. It was identical, around 25% in both arms",
      "B. Induction-first patients showed significantly higher organ preservation",
      "C. Consolidation-first patients (CRT-CNCT) had a higher organ preservation rate than induction-first (INCT-CRT)"
    ],
    correctIndex: 2,
    explanation: "Correct Answer: C\nTME-free survival was ~53% in the CRT→CNCT arm vs. ~41% in the INCT→CRT arm, suggesting consolidation-first improved organ preservation."
  },
  {
    question: "12) Among watch-and-wait patients who developed local regrowth in the OPRA Trial, which statement is correct regarding surgery outcomes?",
    options: [
      "A. Having delayed TME after regrowth did not yield worse DFS compared to patients who had immediate TME",
      "B. Every patient with regrowth died of uncontrolled local disease",
      "C. Delayed TME after regrowth was disallowed by protocol, so no data exist"
    ],
    correctIndex: 0,
    explanation: "Correct Answer: A\nPatients requiring TME after regrowth did not have worse DFS or survival outcomes, supporting close surveillance and delayed surgery if needed."
  },
  {
    question: "13) Which baseline factor emerged as independently predictive of worse DFS in the trial’s multivariate analysis?",
    options: [
      "A. Older age (> 70 years)",
      "B. Clinical nodal positivity (cN1–N2)",
      "C. Tumor distance from anal verge under 2 cm"
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: "Correct Answer: B\nBeing cN+ was associated with higher hazard of DFS events. Age or distance were not as strongly predictive."
  },
  {
    question: "14) What was the approximate 3-year incidence of distant metastases in both arms?",
    options: [
      "A. Nearly 100% in cT4 patients",
      "B. Under 10% in the entire population",
      "C. Around 16–18%, reflecting that roughly four-fifths remained metastasis-free"
    ],
    correctIndex: 2,
    explanation: "Correct Answer: C\nDistant metastasis-free survival at 3 years was ~82–84%, so ~16–18% had distant spread."
  },
  {
    question: "15) Concerning toxicity during total neoadjuvant therapy, which conclusion is accurate?",
    options: [
      "A. Grade 3+ adverse events rates were similar between induction-first and consolidation-first approaches",
      "B. The OPRA trial required prophylactic dose reduction in the consolidation arm",
      "C. More than half the patients discontinued therapy due to intolerance"
    ],
    correctIndex: 0,
    explanation: "Correct Answer: A\nBoth arms had similar incidence of grade ≥3 adverse events, with no major differences in completion rates."
  },
  {
    question: "16) What is one major strength of the OPRA Trial design?",
    options: [
      "A. It mandated that every patient undergo TME and multiple restaging steps",
      "B. It prospectively tested watch-and-wait with two randomized TNT sequences in a multi-institution setting",
      "C. It did not require any imaging before randomization, which reduced selection bias"
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: "Correct Answer: B\nOPRA’s prospective, randomized approach across multiple centers robustly tested watch-and-wait in two distinct TNT arms."
  },
  {
    question: "17) What is one recognized limitation regarding these results on organ preservation?",
    options: [
      "A. There was no mandatory restaging after completion of neoadjuvant therapy",
      "B. Three-year follow-up may be insufficient to capture all late local regrowth or metastases",
      "C. The trial did not evaluate any quality-of-life outcomes or functional results"
    ],
    correctIndex: 2,
    explanation: "Correct Answer: C\nA key limitation is that robust QoL/functional data were not the primary focus, and further follow-up is needed for final survival data."
  },
  {
    question: "18) Why might the OPRA investigators have trouble proving a statistically significant DFS benefit over the historical 75% reference?",
    options: [
      "A. The study was designed as a phase II with limited sample size and not powered for large DFS improvements",
      "B. Both arms used suboptimal chemotherapy regimens that lowered success",
      "C. They did not track local recurrence or metastasis rates"
    ],
    correctIndex: 0,
    explanation: "Correct Answer: A\nOPRA was a phase II trial with moderate enrollment, so it could not definitively surpass the historical DFS reference of 75%."
  },
  {
    question: "19) How might clinicians view a ~50% organ-preservation rate in the context of OPRA’s results?",
    options: [
      "A. They might consider it clinically meaningless without a complete elimination of recurrence",
      "B. It suggests that nearly half of these patients could avoid TME and keep their rectum, with close monitoring",
      "C. It indicates an underestimation of regrowth because MRI is inaccurate"
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: "Correct Answer: B\nAbout half of CRT→CNCT patients avoided TME. This is meaningful for patients wishing to preserve rectal function, given close surveillance."
  },
  {
    question: "20) For a patient with T3N2 rectal cancer who strongly wishes to avoid a permanent colostomy, how might OPRA’s findings help?",
    options: [
      "A. Induction chemo always leads to higher local control, so they can skip radiotherapy",
      "B. The data do not support watch-and-wait for advanced T3N2 disease",
      "C. TNT plus close surveillance can be considered, as nearly half of patients in certain subgroups avoided surgery long-term"
    ],
    correctIndex: 2,
    explanation: "Correct Answer: C\nDespite advanced T3N2 stage, OPRA suggests that a subset may achieve cCR with TNT, offering a potential for WW if carefully followed."
  },
  {
    question: "21) For a clinical team reluctant to delay surgery in favor of WW, what main takeaway supports a wait-and-see approach for complete responders?",
    options: [
      "A. Patients with cCR who later needed surgery for regrowth did not suffer worse outcomes",
      "B. cCR by MRI alone conclusively proves there is zero residual cancer",
      "C. The watch-and-wait approach is guaranteed to prolong overall survival for T4 lesions"
    ],
    correctIndex: 0,
    explanation: "Correct Answer: A\nNo survival disadvantage was seen in patients who underwent TME after local regrowth, reassuring clinicians about delayed surgery if cCR was initially achieved."
  },
  {
    question: "22) In a busy oncology clinic, how might OPRA’s findings alter standard care for rectal cancer?",
    options: [
      "A. Most clinics will abandon TME entirely in all rectal cancer patients",
      "B. Teams may increasingly adopt TNT followed by strict restaging to identify cCR for potential organ preservation",
      "C. The results show that standard chemoradiotherapy alone is always superior"
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: "Correct Answer: B\nOPRA’s data encourage a TNT + restaging approach, letting cCR patients consider watch-and-wait as a viable alternative to immediate TME."
  },
  {
    question: "23) What is a key real-world requirement if a center implements OPRA-like watch-and-wait?",
    options: [
      "A. Universal stoma creation in all patients regardless of response",
      "B. Administering at least 12 cycles of FOLFOX to everyone",
      "C. Ensuring frequent endoscopic and MRI follow-up plus readiness to operate on regrowth"
    ],
    correctIndex: 2,
    explanation: "Correct Answer: C\nImplementing watch-and-wait demands rigorous endoscopic/MRI monitoring and swift surgery if local regrowth appears."
  },
  {
    question: "24) A patient’s restaging scans show “near-complete response.” How does OPRA influence the next step?",
    options: [
      "A. WW can still be offered, provided the patient consents to short-interval surveillance",
      "B. Surgeons must proceed to radical TME immediately",
      "C. Induction chemo must be repeated for another 8 cycles"
    ],
    correctIndex: 0,
    explanation: "Correct Answer: A\nOPRA allowed watch-and-wait in near-cCR, with close follow-up to detect residual disease or early regrowth."
  },
  {
    question: "25) How do OPRA’s findings align with the RAPIDO Trial’s overarching message?",
    options: [
      "A. OPRA contradicts RAPIDO, showing no role for short-course RT in advanced rectal cancer",
      "B. Both underscore that TNT can achieve strong tumor responses and potential for organ preservation in select patients",
      "C. They share identical radiation schedules and identical endpoints"
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: "Correct Answer: B\nBoth demonstrate TNT’s ability to reduce or maintain good DFS and let some patients avoid TME via robust downstaging."
  },
  {
    question: "26) The CAO/ARO/AIO-12 trial (Fokas et al) also compared induction vs. consolidation chemotherapy. How did its main finding compare with OPRA’s results?",
    options: [
      "A. CAO/ARO/AIO-12 concluded induction chemo leads to higher pCR rates",
      "B. OPRA found induction chemo to be superior, whereas CAO/ARO/AIO-12 found no differences",
      "C. Both found that consolidation-first arms were associated with better complete responses/organ preservation"
    ],
    correctIndex: 2,
    explanation: "Correct Answer: C\nCAO/ARO/AIO-12 also showed improved pCR with CRT→consolidation, mirroring OPRA’s higher TME-free survival in the CRT-CNCT group."

  {
    question: "27) In comparison to Habr-Gama’s early watch-and-wait series, OPRA’s main added value is:",
    options: [
      "A. Larger prospective, randomized data clarifying TNT’s effect on cCR rates",
      "B. Purely retrospective design limiting external validity",
      "C. Mandating immediate surgery for all stage II patients"
    ],
    correctIndex: 0,
    explanation: "Correct Answer: A\nOPRA is a prospective, randomized trial across many centers, building on earlier retrospective single-center experiences."
  },
  {
    question: "28) PRODIGE 23 (Conroy et al) used FOLFIRINOX-based TNT. What differentiates OPRA from that approach?",
    options: [
      "A. OPRA mandated short-course radiotherapy, whereas PRODIGE 23 prohibited radiotherapy",
      "B. OPRA used FOLFOX or CAPEOX ± 5-FU/Cap RT, while PRODIGE 23 used a more intensive triple-drug regimen (FOLFIRINOX)",
      "C. Both used identical induction sequences but had different endpoints"
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: "Correct Answer: B\nPRODIGE 23 used FOLFIRINOX, while OPRA used FOLFOX/CAPEOX with concurrent chemoRT, thus different intensities/toxicities."
